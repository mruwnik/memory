# Agent Guidance

- Assume Python 3.10+ features are available; avoid `from __future__ import annotations` unless necessary.
- Prefer straightforward control flow (`if`/`else`) instead of nested ternaries when clarity is improved.
- Tests should be written with @pytest.mark.parametrize where applicable and should avoid test classes
- Make sure linting errors get fixed
