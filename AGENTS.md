# Agent Guidance

- Assume Python 3.10+ features are available; avoid `from __future__ import annotations` unless necessary.
- Treat LLM model identifiers as `<provider>/<model_name>` strings throughout the codebase.
- Prefer straightforward control flow (`if`/`else`) instead of nested ternaries when clarity is improved.
